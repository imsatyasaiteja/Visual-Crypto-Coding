# Visual Crypto Coding
- Visual Crypto Coding is a cryptographic technique that involves encrypting an input image using a randomly generated key.
- The encrypted image can then be decrypted using either the same key (in symmetric encryption) or different keys (in asymmetric encryption methods).
- This technique is particularly useful for ensuring the secure transmission and storage of sensitive images.
- In addition to generating encrypted images, this process also yields decrypted images to verify data integrity.
- This involves ensuring that the decrypted images obtained from all cryptographic algorithms match the original input image, thereby confirming the accuracy of the encryption and decryption processes.
- Further improvements can be done to improve data confidentiality, efficiency of the codes. Please feel free to submit a pull request.
