## Visual-Crypto-Coding

Visual Crypto Coding - Cryptographic technique that involves encryption of an input image using a randomly generated key and decrypt the exact image using the same key. This technique is useful for transmission and storage of highly secure images

Along with the encrypted images, this code also obtains decrypted images to verify data integrity. This means that the decrypted images in all the four algorithms must be same as the input image.

The encryption time all the four algorithms are obtained as follows in EncryptTime.txt file

| Algo | Time         |
|------|--------------|
| DES  | 4939747699 ns|
| 3DES | 4400023999 ns|
| AES  | 4476420593 ns|
| RSA  | 5360362883 ns|

Further improvements and changes can be done to this code to improve data confidentiality, efficiency and much more. Feel free to work with the code and make changes.
